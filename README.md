## Applied Data Science Capstone Thoughts, by Jeremy Schutte
<em>September 24, 2018</em>

To say that I am disappointed by the Applied Data Science specialization track would be an understatement.  A supposed 9 course specialization should lead to a LOT more learning.

In terms of Python data science methods, I learned more from a single Packet Publishing book, Python Machine Learning.

In terms of learning the statistics and the thinking behind intelligent data analysis or data science, I learned far more from a single course from Stanford University Online, Statistical Learning.

A single course and a single book both taught me much more.

I would say that the capstone and the specialization helped me learn jupyter notebooks, which until this point I had barely touched.  They also provided a fair amount of useful example code in the jupyter notebooks scattered through the courses.  

The course was also the first time I really used geospatial data, and for that, I am also thankful.

I would have spent a lot more time on the capstone project if the specialization itself took itself more seriously; or even if just the final capstone course was done with a lot more rigor.

There were so many errors, gaps in knowledge, spelling errors (in a professional course?), that I can say this certificate is near worthless in terms of what it actually teaches.

Shame on you, IBM, for sticking your name on such a hastily slapped together course.

In terms of what I learned from the capstone; well, I could have gone a lot further with it, but again, I don't feel the need to given the above.  Nonetheless, I was quite surprised by the magnitudes of differences in obesity rates across Manhattan and the magnitudes and statistical significance of the correlation of so many types of food with obesity.

As mentioned many times in my paper / notebook, this may largely boil down to differences of income, but then again, maybe not!
